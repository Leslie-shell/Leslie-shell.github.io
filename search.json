There is no force that’s lifting us ever upward.\n 中文翻译:我经常被问到一个问题：你相信进步吗？我不相信进步，至少不认为它是宇宙中的一种力量。引用 Fran Lebowitz 的话：“我不相信任何你必须相信的东西。”因为不存在任何朝向正义弯曲的弧线，也没有任何力量在不断把我们提升。\n 重点词汇&#x2F;表达:\n\nprogress 进步\narc bending toward justice 指正义方向的趋势\nforce lifting us upward 提升我们的力量\n\n例句:\n\nMany people believe in social progress.\nThe arc of history does not necessarily bend toward justice.\nEducation can be a force lifting us upward.\nTechnological progress has transformed human life.\n\n原文:Quite the contrary. The Universe often seems to be out to get us. There are parasites that want to eat us from the inside. There’s the laws of entropy: there are more ways for things to go wrong than to go right. There’s human nature: we were not selected by the processes of evolution to be particularly nice.\n中文翻译:恰恰相反。宇宙似乎总是与我们作对。有些寄生物想从内部吞噬我们。还有熵定律：事情出错的方式比顺利进行的方式更多。人性如此：我们不是通过进化选择出来的特别善良的物种。\n重点词汇&#x2F;表达:\n\nentropy 熵，混乱的自然趋势\nhuman nature 人性\nnot selected to be nice 不是被进化选择为善良的\n\n例句:\n\nChaos increases due to entropy.\nHuman nature is complex and sometimes cruel.\nEvolution did not select us for moral perfection.\nLife often seems out to get us.\n\n原文:We have the capacity for revenge and exploitation. So that’s what’s lined up against us. But nonetheless, progress has happened. How do we explain that? What might seem like a miracle? The answer is ‘rationality.’ If people deploy their rationality, their cognition, their language with the goal of making other people better off — then the result, over time, is what we call ‘progress.’\n中文翻译:我们有复仇和剥削的能力，这就是对我们不利的因素。然而，进步仍然发生了。我们如何解释呢？这看似奇迹的东西是什么？答案是“理性”。如果人们运用理性、认知和语言，目标是让他人生活更好，那么随着时间推移，结果就是我们称之为“进步”的东西。\n重点词汇&#x2F;表达:\n\ncapacity for revenge and exploitation 复仇与剥削的能力\ndeploy rationality 运用理性\nbetter off 更加幸福或富裕\n\n例句:\n\nHumans have the capacity for kindness and cruelty.\nRationality helps solve complex problems.\nEducation can make people better off.\nProgress is often the result of collective rationality.\n\n原文:Can we become more rational? It’s a pressing question because irrational beliefs lead to public health disasters. They can lead to wars and genocides. We’d really be better off if more of us were more rational. My name is Steve Pinker. I am a Professor of Psychology at Harvard University. My most recent book is called “Rationality: What It Is, Why It Seems Scarce, Why It Matters.”\nThere is a capacity in us to become collectively more rational — we can just see it looking backwards. The three great things people desire are to be healthy, wealthy, and wise — and so we can start with those three. Health: meaning in life, is to be alive rather than dead, and longevity has vastly increased. We live more than twice as long as our ancestors.\n中文翻译:我们能变得更理性吗？这是一个紧迫的问题，因为非理性信念会导致公共卫生灾难，甚至引发战争和种族灭绝。如果更多人更理性，我们的生活会更好。我是 Steve Pinker，哈佛大学心理学教授。我的最新著作是《Rationality: What It Is, Why It Seems Scarce, Why It Matters》。\n我们有能力变得集体更理性 — 回顾过去就能看到。人们渴望的三件大事是健康、财富与智慧 — 因此我们可以从这三件事入手。健康意味着活着而非死亡，而且寿命大幅增加。我们现在的寿命是祖先的两倍多。\n重点词汇&#x2F;表达:\n\npressing question 紧迫问题\nirrational beliefs 非理性信念\ncollectively more rational 集体更理性\nlongevity 寿命\n\n例句:\n\nClimate change is a pressing question for our generation.\nSuperstitions are examples of irrational beliefs.\nSocieties can become collectively more rational over time.\nModern medicine has increased human longevity.\n\n原文:So we have not just extra life, but as if we’ve been granted an extra life. Wealthy: 200 years ago, 90% of the world lived in extreme poverty. Today, about 9% of the world lives in extreme poverty, and that proportion falls every day. Wise: our natural state is illiteracy and ignorance. And until pretty recently, a small, aristocratic minority was able to read and write.\n中文翻译:所以我们不仅有额外的生命，好像我们被赋予了额外的生命。财富方面：200年前，全球有90%的人生活在极端贫困中。如今，大约只有9%的人生活在极端贫困中，这一比例每天都在下降。智慧方面：我们的自然状态是文盲和无知。直到不久前，只有少数贵族才能读写。\n重点词汇&#x2F;表达:\n\ngranted 被赋予\nextreme poverty 极端贫困\nilliteracy and ignorance 文盲与无知\naristocratic minority 贵族少数派\n\n例句:\n\nMany people were granted citizenship rights after the reform.\nExtreme poverty has declined globally over the last century.\nIlliteracy remains a challenge in some countries.\nOnly a small aristocratic minority had access to education in the past.\n\n原文:Now it’s a majority; 90% of the world’s population under the age of 25. As Barack Obama said a decade ago, “If you had to choose a period of history to live in, you’d pick now.” When people see my argument that many things have, on average, gotten better: the reaction is often, “Oh, it’s so nice. You’re an optimist.” And I always resist that. I don’t really consider myself an optimist, I just consider myself someone who looks at data rather than headlines. Headlines are guaranteed to make you pessimistic, even cynical, or fatalistic because headlines are a non-random sample, of the worst things happening on Earth, at any given time.\n中文翻译:现在是大多数了：全球25岁以下人口占90%。正如奥巴马十年前所说：“如果你必须选择一个历史时期生活，你会选择现在。”当人们看到我说很多事情总体上变好了时，常常会说：“哦，好棒，你真乐观。”但我总是拒绝这个称呼。我不认为自己是乐观主义者，我只是认为自己是看数据而不是标题的人。标题保证会让你悲观，甚至愤世嫉俗或宿命论，因为标题是地球上最糟事情的非随机样本。\n重点词汇&#x2F;表达:\n\noptimist 乐观主义者\npessimistic, cynical, fatalistic 悲观、愤世嫉俗、宿命论\nnon-random sample 非随机样本\n\n例句:\n\nI try to focus on data, not sensational headlines.\nBeing an optimist doesn’t mean ignoring reality.\nNon-random samples can bias research results.\nSome people are fatalistic about climate change.\n\n原文:It’s when you plot data — and that includes gradual trends — you see with your own eyes how things have gotten better, as a fact about human history. Raising the question of how rational our species is bumps you immediately up against a kind of paradox: By some measures, we’ve never been more rational.\nWe have evidence-based medicine, we’ve got 3D printing, we’ve got robotics, we’ve got artificial intelligence. That’s at the high end, but we are also seeing an awful lot of what you might call ‘Rationality Inequality.’ That is, at the other end, there’s an awful lot of fallacies and irrationalities.\n中文翻译:当你绘制数据——包括渐进趋势——你就能亲眼看到事情变得更好，这是一条关于人类历史的事实。提出人类有多理性的问题，你会立即碰到一种悖论：按某些衡量标准，我们从未如此理性。\n我们有循证医学，有3D打印，有机器人技术，也有人工智能。这是高端例子，但我们也看到大量所谓的“理性不平等”。在另一端，有大量谬误和非理性行为。\n重点词汇&#x2F;表达:\n\nplot data 绘制数据\ngradual trends 渐进趋势\nevidence-based medicine 循证医学\nRationality Inequality 理性不平等\nfallacies 谬误\n\n例句:\n\nPlotting data helps reveal long-term trends.\nEvidence-based medicine saves lives.\nAI represents the high end of technological progress.\nFallacies can lead to poor decision-making.\n\n原文:There are conspiracy theories such as that the Covid vaccines are actually a plot by Bill Gates to inject microchips to surveil us. There’s the big lie that the American Election of 2020 was stolen in defiance of all evidence. How do you explain, or how do I explain — as someone who claims to know a thing or two about rationality — how the same species could indulge in both? Part of the answer is that we are storytelling animals. We spin narratives. That’s one of the ways that we make sense of the world. But we do have a habit to fall back on narratives when it comes to big important questions, like: “How did the world come into being?” “What really happens in the White House?”\n中文翻译:有些阴谋论，比如说新冠疫苗实际上是比尔·盖茨为了监控我们而注射芯片的阴谋。还有一个大谎言：2020年美国大选被窃取，完全无视证据。如何解释，或者说我如何解释——作为一个自称对理性略知一二的人——同一种物种为什么会同时沉迷于两者？部分原因是我们是讲故事的动物。我们编造叙事，这是理解世界的一种方式。但在涉及重大问题时，我们确实习惯依赖叙事，例如：“世界是如何形成的？”“白宫到底发生了什么？”\n重点词汇&#x2F;表达:\n\nconspiracy theory 阴谋论\nbig lie 大谎言\nstorytelling animals 喜欢讲故事的动物\nspin narratives 编造叙事\n\n例句:\n\nConspiracy theories spread rapidly on social media.\nThe big lie can undermine democracy.\nHumans are natural storytelling animals.\nPoliticians often spin narratives to influence opinion.\n\n原文:The ones that make you and your tribe look great, that make your enemies look evil and stupid; that convey the right moral message. We often aren’t so committed to the factual voracity of beliefs that are more in the realm of mythology. We don’t care whether they’re true or false — they’re good things to believe, in that moral community.\n中文翻译:那些让你和你的群体看起来很棒、让你的敌人看起来邪恶愚蠢的叙事；传达正确的道德信息。我们通常不会太在意那些更偏向神话领域信念的真实性。在那个道德群体中，它们是真是假无关紧要——信它们是一件好事。\n重点词汇&#x2F;表达:\n\ntribe 群体\nmoral community 道德共同体\nfactual voracity 事实真实性\nmythology 神话\n\n例句:\n\nEvery tribe has its own moral narratives.\nThe truth often matters less than the story in mythology.\nFactual voracity is essential in scientific research.\nBeliefs can unify a moral community.\n\n\n原文:Now, if you’re a scientist, if you’re a historian, if you’re a journalist, you say, “Well, we could find the answers to those questions.” Cosmology tells us how old the Universe is, and government transcripts of conversations among leaders tell us what actually happened in the White House.\nOur feats of rationality come from institutions, in scientific societies, in government recordkeeping agencies, in responsible journalistic outlets. With this complicated apparatus, we can be, collectively, much more rational than any of us is individually. But it crucially depends on the rules of the game.\n中文翻译:现在，如果你是科学家、历史学家或记者，你会说：“我们可以找到这些问题的答案。”宇宙学告诉我们宇宙有多古老，政府记录领导人谈话的文稿告诉我们白宫究竟发生了什么。\n我们的理性成就来自机构——科学社团、政府档案机构、负责任的新闻媒体。有了这一复杂体系，我们集体上可以比任何个体更加理性。但这关键依赖于“游戏规则”。\n重点词汇&#x2F;表达:\n\ncosmology 宇宙学\ngovernment transcripts 政府记录文稿\nfeats of rationality 理性成就\nrules of the game 游戏规则\n\n例句:\n\nCosmology helps us understand the universe’s age.\nGovernment transcripts reveal historical events.\nInstitutions enhance collective rationality.\nSuccess depends on knowing the rules of the game.\n\n\n原文:Such as, admit you’re wrong when you’re wrong. If you have a claim, you gotta prove it — you can’t just jam it down people’s throats by authority, or power, or prestige. You gotta test your ideas with experiments or data. All of these rules and norms are what allow networks of us to blunder our way toward rationality and truth.\n中文翻译:比如，当你错了就承认。如果你有一个主张，你必须证明它——不能仅凭权威、权力或威望强行灌输。你必须通过实验或数据检验你的想法。所有这些规则和规范让我们网络能够在犯错中逐步走向理性与真理。\n重点词汇&#x2F;表达:\n\nadmit you’re wrong 承认错误\njam down people’s throats 强行灌输\ntest ideas with experiments or data 用实验或数据检验想法\nblunder our way toward 在犯错中前进\n\n例句:\n\nScientists must admit they are wrong when proven incorrect.\nYou cannot jam your opinions down others’ throats.\nTesting ideas with experiments is crucial in research.\nWe often blunder our way toward better solutions.\n\n\n原文:Can more people become more rational? A common answer among, you know, my people is “education!” We’ve got to teach kids critical thinking, but education can’t be the only part of the answer. And the reason is all too familiar: Students take a course, they cram for the exam. The exam is over, by the time the ink is dry, they forgot most of what they crammed for in the exam.\nIt can’t just be you take a course in critical thinking. It’s gotta be that the principles of critical thinking are just part of what it means to be a decent, thinking, respectable person. So if you’re writing an op-ed, or a blog post, or commenting on a tweet, or even having an argument in a bar, you gotta keep those principles of critical thinking.\n中文翻译:更多人能变得更理性吗？在我圈子里一个常见答案是“教育！”我们必须教孩子批判性思维，但教育不能是唯一答案。原因很熟悉：学生上课，为考试死记硬背。考试结束，墨水刚干，他们就忘了大部分死记硬背的内容。\n不仅仅是上批判性思维课程，而是批判性思维的原则必须成为成为一个正直、有思考能力、有尊严的人的一部分。因此，无论你写专栏、博客、评论推文，甚至在酒吧争论，都必须坚持这些批判性思维原则。\n重点词汇&#x2F;表达:\n\ncritical thinking 批判性思维\ncram for the exam 临时抱佛脚\ndecent, thinking, respectable person 正直、有思考能力、有尊严的人\nop-ed 社论文章\n\n例句:\n\nTeaching critical thinking is essential in schools.\nStudents often cram for the exam instead of understanding the material.\nBeing a decent, thinking, respectable person requires rational habits.\nAlways apply critical thinking, even in casual arguments.\n\n\n原文:It’s gotta be part of our norms. It’s gotta be, like, not going out naked in public. Several hundred years ago people believed in the existence of werewolves and unicorns. People believed that you could placate angry gods by sacrificing innocent people. People would take the whole family out to laugh at the insane in an asylum for entertainment on a Sunday afternoon.\nSo there is hope. It doesn’t happen instantly. It doesn’t happen to everyone. They’ll always be pockets of irrationality. But we can try to kind of steer the ocean liner, slowly and gradually, in the direction of greater rationality.\n中文翻译:它必须成为我们的规范之一，就像不要在公共场合裸奔一样。几百年前，人们相信狼人和独角兽的存在。人们认为可以通过牺牲无辜者来安抚愤怒的神灵。人们会带上全家在星期日下午去笑看精神病院里的病人作为娱乐。\n所以还是有希望的。这不会瞬间发生，也不会发生在每个人身上。总会有非理性的存在。但我们可以尝试慢慢地、逐步地引导“巨轮”，朝着更理性的方向前进。\n重点词汇&#x2F;表达:\n\nnorms 规范\nplacate angry gods 安抚愤怒的神灵\npockets of irrationality 非理性存在\nsteer the ocean liner 比喻稳步引导\n\n例句:\n\nFollowing social norms is important for civilization.\nAncient people tried to placate angry gods with sacrifices.\nThere are always pockets of irrationality in society.\nWe must steer the ocean liner of society toward progress.\n\n\n\n","categories":["English","Video"],"tags":["English","EnglishListening"]},{"title":"Vocabulary","url":"/2025/09/13/english/x-english--word--work%20related%20words/","content":"regulator\n词义：监管者\n例句：\nThe financial regulators are responsible for ensuring fair competition. 金融监管者负责确保公平竞争。\nRegulators monitor the banking industry. 监管者监督银行业。\nThe energy regulators set electricity prices. 能源监管者设定电价。\nRegulators enforce environmental laws. 监管者执行环境法规。\n\n\n\n\neconomic\n词义：经济的\n例句：\nEconomic growth is a priority for the government. 政府优先考虑经济增长。\nThe country faces economic challenges. 该国面临经济挑战。\nEconomic policies affect employment rates. 经济政策影响就业率。\nHe studied economic trends in Asia. 他研究亚洲的经济趋势。\n\n\n\n\nmacroeconomic\n词义：宏观经济学\n说明：包括全球和国家范围内的经济活动，关注经济总体指标、政策和趋势，以及这些因素如何相互作用。\n例句：\nMacroeconomic indicators show inflation is rising. 宏观经济指标显示通胀在上升。\nThe central bank implements macroeconomic policies. 中央银行执行宏观经济政策。\nAnalysts study macroeconomic trends to forecast growth. 分析师研究宏观经济趋势以预测增长。\nUnemployment rates are a key macroeconomic measure. 失业率是一个关键的宏观经济指标。\n\n\n\n\nmicroeconomic\n词义：微观经济学\n说明：着眼于市场机制、价格形成、供需关系以及个体如何最大化其效用和利润。\n例句：\nMicroeconomic theory explains consumer behavior. 微观经济学理论解释消费者行为。\nThe company analyzed microeconomic factors before setting prices. 公司在定价前分析了微观经济因素。\nSupply and demand are central concepts in microeconomics. 供需是微观经济学的核心概念。\nMicroeconomic models help firms maximize profits. 微观经济模型帮助企业实现利润最大化。\n\n\n\n\nprojection\n词义：投射；预测；规划\n例句：\nThe projection of future sales is very important for the company. 对未来销售额的预测对公司非常重要。\nEconomic projections suggest growth next year. 经济预测显示明年将增长。\nThe architect made a projection of the building on the wall. 建筑师在墙上投射了建筑图。\nThe projection of the budget shows a deficit. 预算预测显示赤字。\n\n\n\n\ndisperse\n词义：分散；驱散\n例句：\nThe crowd began to disperse after the concert. 音乐会结束后人群开始散开。\nThe police used tear gas to disperse the protesters. 警方使用催泪瓦斯驱散抗议者。\nSeeds disperse with the wind. 种子随风传播。\nThe clouds slowly dispersed in the sky. 天空中的云慢慢消散。\n\n\n\n\noutstanding balance\n词义：未结清余额\n例句：\nYou need to pay your outstanding balance by the end of the month. 你需要在本月底前支付未结清余额。\nThe bank sent a notice about my outstanding balance. 银行寄来关于我未结清余额的通知。\nCustomers with outstanding balances cannot make new purchases. 未结清余额的客户无法进行新购买。\nThe company keeps track of all outstanding balances. 公司追踪所有未结清余额。\n\n\n\n\n词汇整理\naggregation\n解释：聚集；集合  \n例句：  \nThe aggregation of data is necessary for analysis. 数据聚集对于分析是必要的。  \nThe aggregation of small companies led to a larger corporation. 小公司的合并形成了一个大公司。  \nAggregation of information helps in decision-making. 信息的汇总有助于决策。  \nSocial media allows for the aggregation of user opinions. 社交媒体让用户意见得以汇集。\n\n\n\n\ndimensions\n解释：尺寸；规模；方面  \n例句：  \nWhat are the dimensions of this room?
